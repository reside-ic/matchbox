Authors@R: c(person("Rich", "FitzJohn", role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Utilities for matching data against a know list of good
    values ("a data dictionary"), and tools to create such
    dictionaries.  The hope is that this approach reduces the amount
    of data cleaning code written, with most cleaning being done by
    editing files of metadata.
